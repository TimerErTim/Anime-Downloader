## Introduction

There are many ways to contribute. From submitting bug reports or feature requests to improving documentation or
extending the source code, everything that helps to move this project forward is a welcome contribution. Since this
project is not well known as of now, advertising and recommending this repository, and the software it provides, is
incredibly helpful and can be done by anyone.

## Getting Started

## Testing

Always test your code before submitting Pull Requests and make sure any changes or additions you make actually work.
Write your tests in the test module under `src/test`. Tests should be named after the class they test appended
with `Test`
and be placed in the same package as the tested class. Create that package if it doesn't exit already.

The project provides JUnit for automated testing. You can use this library or test manually. Either way, be confident
the code works and doesn't break anything.
